ManZen 
======

**An experiment about porting Mantis to Zend Framework**


What's this?
------------

This branch contains a Zend based project to wrap the original Mantis code.
The goal is to start working with Zend for new classes and gradually move
old code and pages to use Zend based code.

Longer term, we could eventually replace all legacy files and release a Zend 
based Mantis 3.0!


Installation
------------

To use the ManZen branch, please download the Zend library (the "Minimal"
variant is just fine) from:
http://framework.zend.com/download/latest

Then unpack the archive and copy (or symlink) the library/Zend directory
into the mantisbt/library directory or in any path in your php_include_path.


License
-------

The default license for new code is the ISC License, a BSD variant with a 
shorter text; here is the template:
